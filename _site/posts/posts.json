Since then, the virus has spread like wildfire across the globe, with countries struggling to contain the virus to curb further spread and resurgence.\r\nExperts believe that COVID-19 is less deadly but more infectious than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003. Although the number of deaths due to COVID-19 reached a staggering 2.85 million worldwide, its case fatality ratio or rate (defined as the proportion of deaths among a defined population of interest, in this case, the number of COVID-19 cases) is estimated at 1.4% to 3.4%, a far cry from the 9.6% of SARS and 34.3% of the lesser known Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Of the 2.85 million deaths, how do countries compare against each other? Are there any factors that could have an impact on the number of deaths?\r\nCurrent visualisations on COVID-19 deaths\r\nThe most frequently shown analysis on the COVID-19 deaths are:\r\nTime series analysis: number of deaths and/or case fatality ratio for each country, plotted on a time series scale (see Figure 1)\r\nGeo-spatial analysis: number of deaths and/or case fatality ratio shown on the map as a choropleth, point symbol map or proportional symbol map (see Figure 2)\r\nTabular analysis: table of death statistics with horizontal data bars to provide visual comparisons between countries/locations (see Figure 1)\r\nFigure 1: Table with horizontal data bars and time series analysis.Source: https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/2019-ncov/covid-19-data-visualisationFigure 2:(Left) Proportional symbol map showing the case fatality ratio by location.Source: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html(Right) Choropleth of daily confirmed deaths per million people.Source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deathsThe time series and geo-spatial visualisations\r\nConducting literature review on how the analysis were performed before. The focus should be on identifying gaps whereby interactive web approach and visual analytics techniques can be used to enhance user experience on using the analysis techniques.\r\nIn this sub-module, the questions that we want to answer are:\r\nHow do countries compare against each other in the total number of deaths due to COVID-19?\r\nWhat is the relationship between the deaths and the country’s standing in different areas e.g. number of COVID-19 cases, healthcare systems and expenditure, population make-up, human development index?\r\nStoryboard\r\nData Preparation\r\nLoading all necessary packages for file import\r\nThe following code chunk loads the necessary packages required for importing data files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImporting files into R\r\nImport and selection of variables\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCleaning the data\r\nWant to join all values into one main table covid_deaths.

    "contents": "\r\nIntroduction\r\nOne of the three shifts that the Singapore government is making to keep healthcare affordable and sustainable is to bring healthcare closer to homes and support ageing in the community. To achieve this, public healthcare services are organised into three clusters overseeing a specific region:\r\nCentral region: National Healthcare Group (NHG)\r\nEastern region: Singapore Health Services (SingHealth)\r\nWestern region: National University Health System (NUHS)\r\nThis segregation would allow the clusters to better coordinate care delivery along the care continuum from primary, acute, intermediate to long-term care, in their respective regions (Ministry of Health, Singapore, 2018).\r\nIn Singapore General Hospital, part of the SingHealth cluster, the Community Care Team (CCT), comprising of Medical Social Workers (MSWs), was formed in mid 2018. The aim of the CCT is to facilitate person-centred care in the community and to enable patients to remain in the community as long as possible. This is achieved through collaboration with community partners to meet patient psychosocial needs with health and social issues.\r\nIn order to explore the breadth and depth of psychosocial needs in the community and to devise targeted intervention strategies to address them, the Psychosocial Acuity Scale (PAS), established in the University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, was introduced and is being used to capture patient’s data based on their psychosocial needs (Klett, Firn, Abney, Battles, Harrington & Vantine, 2014). The PAS is a clinical measure and tool used to assess the patient/family/community situation prior to any social work involvement. It consists of seven domains, with each domain having four acuity levels.\r\nThis project looks at providing an application to aid in the visualisation and analysis of the data collected by the CCT MSWs.\r\nMotivation\r\nThe project team is motivated to help the CCT MSWs to discover trends and gain insights on the psychosocial acuity of patients in the community. The analysis tool will enable the MSW team to identify current trends and service needs, which would in turn inform the MSWs on the potential intervention strategies required in the community. This would have both practice and health and social care policy implications on enabling patients to age well in the community.\r\nWhile the dataset is meant for data analysis, it has been mainly used for case monitoring and workload statistics purposes. To enhance and facilitate the analysis task for the MSWs, the project team will attempt to provide an easy-to-use and interactive application. It is also an opportune time to start analysing their data, after allowing the CCT team’s systems and processes to stabilise since its formation in mid 2018.\r\nData\r\nThe data is split into three files, one for each MSW. The fields can be categorised into the following areas:\r\nPatient’s sociodemographics and postal code\r\nReferral details\r\nMSW assessment details including the PAS levels\r\nEach file contains the patient assessment records done by the respective MSW from mid 2018 to 2020. There could be repeated assessments for the same patient at different times.\r\nMethodology and Approach\r\nThe following is the proposed scope of the project.\r\nAnalysis and preparation of PAS dataset\r\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\nTime Series and Geo-spatial Analysis\r\nClustering Analysis\r\nMultiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Predictive Modelling\r\nDevelopment of R-Shiny mobile application for user interactivity\r\nStoryboard\r\nThere will be four sections in the final app. The first section will be on Time Series and Geo-spatial Analysis. The second section will be on Clustering Analysis and the third section will be on Regression and Prediction Modelling. The fourth section will allow the user to explore with the data used in the application.\r\nProposed layouts and features of the sections are as follow.\r\nTime Series & Geo-Spatial Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Proposed screen for Time Series and Geo-Spatial Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClustering Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Proposed screen for Clustering Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression and Predictive Modelling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Proposed screen for Regression and Predictive Modelling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData Exploration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Proposed screen for Data Exploration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Timeline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Project Timeline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware Tool\r\nThe application will be written in R using RStudio.\r\nR Packages\r\nThe following R packages would be used:\r\nDT: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT\r\nggplot2: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html\r\nleaflet: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet\r\nlubridate: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html\r\nplotly: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly\r\nreadr: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr\r\nshiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com\r\nshinythemes: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinythemes\r\nshinyWidgets: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyWidgets\r\ntidyverse: https://www.tidyverse.org\r\ncorrplot: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot\r\npurr: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/purrr/index.html\r\nrgdal: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal\r\nrgeos: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgeos\r\ncluster: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cluster/index.html\r\ndendextend https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dendextend\r\nMASS: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html\r\nReferences\r\nMinistry of Health, Singapore (14 Aug 2018).
